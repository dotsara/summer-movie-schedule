# Summer blockbusters, 2019

My friends and I watch movies (or TV) as a group each week. This summer, we're choosing summer blockbusters from years past (basically from _Jaws_ (1975) forward). I'm going to write a script that puts them in a random order, assigning them dates from almost mid-June through Labor Day. 

~Stay tuned! ðŸ“º~
